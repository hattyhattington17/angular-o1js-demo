 * Verify an ECDSA signature.

 * Details about the `config` parameter:
 * - For both the generator point `G` and public key `P`, `config` allows you to specify:
 *   - the `windowSize` which is used in scalar multiplication for this point.
 *     this flexibility is good because the optimal window size is different for constant and non-constant points.
 *     empirically, `windowSize=4` for constants and 3 for variables leads to the fewest constraints.
 *     our defaults reflect that the generator is always constant and the public key is variable in typical applications.
 *   - a table of multiples of those points, of length `2^windowSize`, which is used in the scalar multiplication gadget to speed up the computation.
 *     if these are not provided, they are computed on the fly.
 *     for the constant G, computing multiples costs no constraints, so passing them in makes no real difference.
 *     for variable public key, there is a possible use case: if the public key is a public input, then its multiples could also be.
 *     in that case, passing them in would avoid computing them in-circuit and save a few constraints.
 * - The initial aggregator `ia`, see {@link initialAggregator}. By default, `ia` is computed deterministically on the fly.
 *
 *
 * _Note_: If `signature.s` is a non-canonical element, an error will be thrown.
 * If `signature.r` is non-canonical, however, `false` will be returned.
